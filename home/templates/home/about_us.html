            <p>
                Founded in 2010 in the beautiful city of Rostock, CozyNest started as a small family business with a
                simple mission: to bring warmth, comfort, and style into every bedroom. Over the years, we have grown
                into a trusted name in premium bedding, offering high-quality products that combine softness,
                durability, and elegant design.
            </p>
            <p>
                At CozyNest, we believe that your bedroom should be a sanctuary - a place where you can relax, recharge,
                and feel truly cozy. Our collection includes soft cotton bedding, cotton duvet covers in all sizes,
                decorative pillow covers, toddler bedding sets, warm blankets, and cozy cotton pajamas - everything
                designed to make your home feel welcoming and comfortable.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are proud to export our products worldwide, sharing the comfort and quality of CozyNest with homes
                across the globe. As a family-run company, we value attention to detail, personal service, and creating
                products that bring joy to our customers every day.
