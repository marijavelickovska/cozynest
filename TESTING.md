## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

| Directory | File | URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| products | [products.css](https://github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/blob/main/products/static/products/css/products.css) | | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/css-products-products.png) | |
| profiles | [profile.css](https://github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/blob/main/profiles/static/profiles/css/profile.css) | | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/css-profiles-profile.png) | |
| static | [base.css](https://github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/blob/main/static/css/base.css) | | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/css-static-base.png) | |


### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.

| Directory | File | URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| templates | [base.html](https://github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/blob/main/templates/base.html) |  | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/js-template-base.png) | Validator shows warnings related to Bootstrap usage. These warnings are acceptable. |
| products | [products.html](https://github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/blob/main/products/templates/products/products.html) |  | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/js-products-products.png) | |
| products | [product_detail.html](https://github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/blob/main/products/templates/products/product_detail.html) |  | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/js-products-product_detail.png) | |

| bag | [bag.html](https://github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/blob/main/bag/templates/bag/bag.html) |  | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/js-bag-bag.png) | JSHint shows "unused variable" warnings for `max` and `min` in incrementQty/decrementQty functions because they are only called from HTML attributes. This is a false positive; code is correct and works as intended. |
| checkout | [checkout.html](https://github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/blob/main/checkout/templates/checkout/checkout.html) |  | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/js-checkout-checkout.png) | Validator shows warnings related to Stripe usage. These warnings are acceptable. |


### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. Some warnings are outside of my control, and mobile results tend to be lower than desktop.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

> [!NOTE]  
> I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality. In order to run the tests, I ran the following commands in the terminal each time:

- `python manage.py test products.tests.test_forms`
- `python manage.py test products.tests.test_views`
- `python manage.py test profiles.tests.test_views`

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

- `pip3 install coverage`
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- `coverage run --omit="*/site-packages/*,*/migrations/*,*/__init__.py,env.py,.env" manage.py test`
- `coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

- `coverage html`
- `python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the full coverage report on my application that I've tested:

## Bugs

### Fixed Bugs

[![GitHub issue custom search](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-search/marijavelickovska/cozynest?query=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20label%3Abug&label=Fixed%20Bugs&color=green)](https://www.github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug)

I've used [GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/issues) to track and manage bugs and issues during the development stages of my project.

### Known Issues

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of, though, even after thorough testing, I cannot rule out the possibility.

### Other Findings

> Product prices are manually set using fixtures without strict association to specific products or sizes. 
  As a result, some prices may appear inconsistent. These values are intended only for testing purposes.

> The links under "Special Offers" in the navbar currently do not lead to any products. This layout was kept for visual purposes, as it makes the navbar look nicer. Functionality for these links is planned for future implementation.
