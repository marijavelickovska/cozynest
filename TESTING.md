### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

| Directory | File | URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| products | [products.css](https://github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/blob/main/products/static/products/css/products.css) | | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/css-products-products.png) | |
| profiles | [profile.css](https://github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/blob/main/profiles/static/profiles/css/profile.css) | | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/css-profiles-profile.png) | |
| static | [base.css](https://github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/blob/main/static/css/base.css) | | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/css-static-base.png) | |


### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.

| Directory | File | URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| templates | [base.html](https://github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/blob/main/templates/base.html) |  | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/js-template-base.png) | Validator shows warnings related to Bootstrap usage. These warnings are acceptable. |
| products | [products.html](https://github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/blob/main/products/templates/products/products.html) |  | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/js-products-products.png) | |
| products | [product_detail.html](https://github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/blob/main/products/templates/products/product_detail.html) |  | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/js-products-product_detail.png) | |

| bag | [bag.html](https://github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/blob/main/bag/templates/bag/bag.html) |  | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/js-bag-bag.png) | JSHint shows "unused variable" warnings for `max` and `min` in incrementQty/decrementQty functions because they are only called from HTML attributes. This is a false positive; code is correct and works as intended. |
| checkout | [checkout.html](https://github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/blob/main/checkout/templates/checkout/checkout.html) |  | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/js-checkout-checkout.png) | Validator shows warnings related to Stripe usage. These warnings are acceptable. |


### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

## Lighthouse Audit

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports. Avoid testing the local version (Gitpod/VSCode/etc.), as this can have knock-on effects for performance. If you don't have "Lighthouse" in your Developer Tools, it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Unless your project is a single-page application (SPA), you should test Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages, for both *mobile* and *desktop*.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. Some warnings are outside of my control, and mobile results tend to be lower than desktop.

## Defensive Programming

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important! When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each form field. Examples of this could include (but not limited to):

All Projects:

- Users cannot submit an empty form (add the `required` attribute)
- Users must enter valid field types (ensure the correct input `type=""` is used)
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted pages

Python Projects:

- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality if not authenticated (if login functionality exists)
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers/admins

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form, or CRUD functionality, for data manipulation on a database. Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser). You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

Testing should be replicable (can someone else replicate the same outcome?). Ideally, tests cases should focus on each individual section of every page on the website. Each test case should be specific, objective, and step-wise replicable.

Instead of adding a general overview saying that everything works fine, consider documenting tests on each element of the page (eg. button clicks, input box validation, navigation links, etc.) by testing them in their "happy flow", their "bad/exception flow", mentioning the expected and observed results, and drawing a parallel between them where applicable.

Consider using the following format for manual test cases:

- Expected Outcome / Test Performed / Result Received / Fixes Implemented

- **Expected**: "Feature is expected to do X when the user does Y."
- **Testing**: "Tested the feature by doing Y."
- (either) **Result**: "The feature behaved as expected, and it did Y."
- (or) **Result**: "The feature did not respond to A, B, or C."
- **Fix**: "I did Z to the code because something was missing."

Use the table below as a basic start, and expand on it using the logic above.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

## User Story Testing

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Testing User Stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **Features** should already align with the **User Stories**, so this should be as simple as creating a table with the User Story, matching with the re-used screenshot from the respective Feature.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

> [!NOTE]  
> I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Adjust the code below (file names, function names, etc.) to match your own project files/folders. Use these notes loosely when documenting your own Python Unit tests, and remove/adjust where applicable.

⚠️ SAMPLE ⚠️

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality. In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

- `python3 manage.py test name-of-app`

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

- `pip3 install coverage`
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- `coverage run --omit="*/site-packages/*,*/migrations/*,*/__init__.py,env.py,.env" manage.py test`
- `coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

- `coverage html`
- `python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the full coverage report on my application that I've tested:

![screenshot](documentation/automation/html-coverage.png)

#### Unit Test Issues

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this section to list any known issues you ran into while writing your Python unit tests. Remember to include screenshots (where possible), and a solution to the issue (if known). This can be used for both "fixed" and "unresolved" issues. Remove this sub-section entirely if you somehow didn't run into any issues while working with your tests.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

## Bugs

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Nobody likes bugs,... except the assessors! Projects seem more suspicious if a student doesn't properly track their bugs. If you're about to submit your project without any bugs listed below, you should ask yourself why you're doing this course in the first place, if you're able to build this entire application without running into any bugs. The best thing you can do for any project is to document your bugs! Not only does it show the true stages of development, but think of it as breadcrumbs for yourself in the future, should you encounter the same/similar bug again, it acts as a gentle reminder on what you did to fix the bug.

If/when you encounter bugs during the development stages of your project, you should document them here, ideally with a screenshot explaining what the issue was, and what you did to fix the bug.

Alternatively, an improved way to manage bugs is to use the built-in **[Issues](https://www.github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/issues)** tracker on your GitHub repository. This can be found at the top of your repository, the tab called "Issues".

If using the Issues tracker for bug management, you can simplify the documentation process for testing. Issues allow you to directly paste screenshots into the issue page without having to first save the screenshot locally. You can add labels to your issues (e.g. `bug`), assign yourself as the owner, and add comments/updates as you progress with fixing the issue(s). Once you've solved the issue/bug, you should then "Close" it.

When showcasing your bug tracking for assessment, you can use the following examples below.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

### Fixed Bugs

[![GitHub issue custom search](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-search/marijavelickovska/cozynest?query=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20label%3Abug&label=Fixed%20Bugs&color=green)](https://www.github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug)

I've used [GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/issues) to track and manage bugs and issues during the development stages of my project.

All previously closed/fixed bugs can be tracked [here](https://www.github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug).

![screenshot](documentation/bugs/gh-issues-closed.png)

### Unfixed Bugs

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

You will need to mention any unfixed bugs and why they are not fixed upon submission of your project. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. Where possible, you must fix all outstanding bugs, unless outside of your control.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here! It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue, they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

[![GitHub issue custom search](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-search/marijavelickovska/cozynest?query=is%3Aissue%2Bis%3Aopen%2Blabel%3Abug&label=Unfixed%20Bugs&color=red)](https://www.github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)

Any remaining open issues can be tracked [here](https://www.github.com/marijavelickovska/cozynest/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug).

### Known Issues

| Issue | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have horizontal `overflow-x` scrolling. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/overflow.png) |
| When validating HTML with a semantic `<section>` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/section-header.png) |
| Validation errors on "signup.html" coming from the Django Allauth package. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/allauth.png) |
| With a known order-number, users can brute-force "checkout_success.html" and see potentially sensitive information. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/checkout-success.png) |
| If a product is in your bag/cart, but then gets deleted from the database, it throws errors from the session storage memory. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/session-storage.png) |
| The `-`/`+` quantity buttons work well on "product_details.html", but not on "bag.html". | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/quantity-buttons.png) |

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of, though, even after thorough testing, I cannot rule out the possibility.
